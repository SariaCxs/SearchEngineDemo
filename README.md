## System Architecture

* **Spider**

  * fetch and parse webpages 

    Jsoup: Java HTML Parser

  * store webpage information and link relation to database

    JDBM(support scalable data structures, such as HTree and B+Tree, to support persistence of large object collections)

* **Indexer**

  * Process webpage, create inverted index, forward index and other statistic information
  * Store index files to database

* **Searcher**

  * Load index files to get information for searching
  * Rank results based on cosine similarity score, PageRank value, and title matched score

* **Web Server**

  * A web interface to users(Tomcat)
  * Forward users' request to Searcher and display searching result

## Requirement

- IntelliJ IDEA
- JDK 21
- Maven 3


## Installation

```
 git clone https://github.com/SariaCxs/search_engine_demo.git
```

* Configuration on IDEA

* Modify `URL`  and click `Deploy application configured in Tomcat instance`

* add the application when the server stars in the Deployment

## Running 

When we start the Tomcat for deployment, the server will only read file in the `bin` directory of the installment path of Tomcat. To make sure that the `index` files and `stopwords` file can be read, you need to change two the directory in two file, `indexer/IndexDB` and `utils/TokenizerHandler`.

Find the **Main class** and run it to perform crawling and indexing, and calculating cosine similarity wieights and page rank value.

After fetching 304 webpages, the index files are stored under the root directory of the project.

## Search examples

1. Input `Magical Rescue` for testing title favor

2. Input `"computer science"` for testing phrase search

   We use double quota to indicate recognizing the content inside as a phrase.

3. Input `movie`s for testing the PageRank 

   There are many pages pointing to the webpage that ranks first.
